# Your starting point for your next great web app

This is a fork from [Terlici's Base Express project][fork] based on
[an article][article] written on their site.

The purpose for this repository is to serve as a base project for your next
[Node][node] and [Express][express] web app. Clone it and you are ready to go.

It will provide you with a simple but solid structure on which to build on. We
will do our best to keep it up to date with the latest node and express
versions.

This repository differs from [the original][fork] by using [Nunjucks][nunjucks],
instead of [Jade][jade] as its template engine.
